# Minecraft-MCFunction
A Datapack for Java Edition And Bedrock Edition!

The Datapack Version Will Be 1.16.x - 1.18.x

Reasons Why I create Datapack Instead using Command Blocks :

1. if you accidentally deleted your command block world you can't get it unless you make a backups
2. If something wrong on the command block, the world would get UNPLAYABLE because of that
3. You always need to carry redstone and command blocks whenever you go.
